# Contributing to GOSH

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **GOSH** (Goose Shell)! GOSH is an open-source Unix shell written primarily in the [Goose programming language](https://github.com/goose-lang), combining fast startup and execution with modern interactive features.

---

## Prerequisites

To build and contribute to GOSH, you will need:

1. **Goose Compiler**: Ensure `goose` is installed and available on your `$PATH`.
   - Verify with: `goose version`
2. **C Toolchain**: A standard C compiler (`gcc` or `clang`), required by Goose for compiling the native C interop layer and producing the final ELF binary.
   - Verify with: `gcc --version` or `clang --version`
3. **Python 3**: Python 3.8+ for runner validation and the optional benchmark suite.
   - Verify with: `python3 --version`

## Development Workflow

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/voidssx1/gosh.git
cd gosh
```

### 2. Building GOSH
Build the executable from source using Goose:
```bash
goose build -o bin/gosh src/gosh.goose
```
This produces the standalone binary `bin/gosh`.

### 3. Testing Your Changes
Always run the automated test suite before committing changes:
```bash
./test/test_suite.sh
```
The Bash runner finds `bin/gosh` relative to the repository, regardless of your working directory. To test another build:
```bash
GOSH="/path/to/custom build/gosh" ./test/test_suite.sh
```
`GOSH` must be an executable file path, absolute or relative to your working directory. Invalid paths fail early with build or permission instructions. Temporary files use `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` and are removed on exit.

Add cases to `test/test_suite.sh` for new features and fixes. Each case checks combined stdout/stderr (ignoring trailing newlines) and exit status:
```bash
run_test "description" "command" "expected output"  # expects status 0
run_test "explicit failure" "exit 7" "" 7
```
A mismatch in either output or status fails the case; the runner continues and exits nonzero after reporting the totals.

Validate the runner itself without Goose or a built GOSH binary:
```bash
bash -n test/test_suite.sh
python3 test/test_runner.py
```
Runner checks use stand-in executables; also run the suite against a real GOSH build before submitting.

Input capacity regressions are included in the portable suite. GOSH rejects a
parse with status 2 when it exceeds 63 tokens (plus EOF), 8 statements, 4 pipeline
stages, 16 command words (including the command name), 4 redirections, or 16
`for` words. Token text is limited to 128 bytes, including preserved quote and
substitution syntax. Parser fields also enforce their existing byte capacities:
32 for function/loop variable names, 64 for assignment names, 256 for condition
and else text, and 512 for body/function text. Reconstructed compound text counts
inserted spaces and separators. Script files are limited to 32768 bytes.

These checks apply to each parse, including recursively parsed bodies. A failure
prevents execution of that parse; it does not roll back earlier recursive calls.
Expansion output, alias reconstruction, interactive line editing, positional
arguments supplied to GOSH itself, and shell state tables retain their existing
fixed limits and are outside these lexer/parser checks.

Run the focused startup regressions against a real build (uses isolated HOME
folders and pseudo-terminals for interactive startup):
```bash
python3 test/test_startup.py
```
They also run as part of `test/test_suite.sh`; `GOSH` selects another binary.

Completion regressions exercise the real Goose completion module with isolated PATH
fixtures (including executable permissions and empty PATH entries):
```bash
python3 test/test_completion.py
```
This harness builds a temporary Goose probe using GOSH's native build configuration.
It requires the Goose compiler and C toolchain; a missing compiler fails explicitly.

### 4. Running Benchmarks
To evaluate performance impacts:
```bash
./bench/run_benchmarks.sh
```

The runner validates each workload before timing and applies a 10-second timeout
to each subprocess. Failed checks or runs appear as `FAILED` in the console and
report, and make the runner exit nonzero. Results distinguish total milliseconds
from mean milliseconds per run.

Run the focused benchmark-runner tests without Goose or a built GOSH binary:
```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s test -p 'test_benchmark.py' -v
```

## Architectural Principles

When writing or modifying code in GOSH, please keep the following design rules in mind:

- **Goose First**: GOSH is primarily written in Goose. Lexing, parsing, AST execution, variable expansion, builtins, line editing, and process management logic must reside in Goose (`src/*.goose`).
- **Minimal, Isolated C Interop**: Low-level POSIX system calls unavailable in the Goose standard library (e.g. `fork`, `execvp`, `pipe`, `dup2`, `tcsetattr`, `waitpid`) belong in `src/gosh_os.c` and `src/gosh_os.h`, wrapped cleanly via `src/gosh_os.goose`. Do not move high-level shell logic into C.
- **No External Runtime Dependencies**: GOSH builds into a self-contained native binary. Avoid introducing external third-party libraries.
- **Safety and Robustness**: Check return values of system calls and handle errors cleanly without crashing or leaving zombie processes.

## Submitting Pull Requests

1. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```
2. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.
3. Verify that `goose check src/gosh.goose` and `./test/test_suite.sh` pass cleanly.
4. Push your branch and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch.
